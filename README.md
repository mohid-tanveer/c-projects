projects in c

# introduction

In this repository I have compiled a list of projects that I worked on in the language C
during my 2nd semester of my Sophomore Year at Rhodes College.

These projects consist of many different ideas that I learned within the course I was taking
at the time entitled Systems Programming.

# main takeaways

The objectives of these projects were to:

* demonstrate an ability to properly manage memory using data structures within C;
* to write nontrivial programs, library code to use in client programs, client programs, and networking programs;
* demonstrate a mastery of C syntax and semantics;
* and to demonstrate an ability to learn and adapt to different aspects of new programming languages and common practices.

# conclusion

I hope that looking through these projects allows for you to see the learned applications of many instances of programming within the language of C and the personality of the programmer (me) through my attention to detail, organization tendencies, and overall eagerness to learn and adapt.
